# Procedural Terrain Generation

[![Windows](https://github.com/math-araujo/procedural-terrain-generation/actions/workflows/Windows.yml/badge.svg?event=push)](https://github.com/math-araujo/procedural-terrain-generation/actions/workflows/Windows.yml) [![Ubuntu](https://github.com/math-araujo/procedural-terrain-generation/actions/workflows/Ubuntu.yml/badge.svg?event=push)](https://github.com/math-araujo/procedural-terrain-generation/actions/workflows/Ubuntu.yml)

This project is a C++20/OpenGL 4.5 implementation of a procedural terrain generator on GPU using coherent noise. It uses compute shaders to create heightmaps based on 2D fractal Brownian noise (fBm). To calculate normal vectors based on the terrain height, it uses compute shaders that leverages the shared memory of GPU blocks to apply the Sobel operator on the heightmap. The heightmap is then used by tessellation shaders to generate a triangulation for the terrain, with dynamic level-of-detail (LOD) based on the camera distance. Since the triangles are generated dynamically on the GPU, instead of precomputed UV-coordinates for each triangle vertex, triplanar texture mapping is used to assign texture coordinates on-the-fly. The reflections on the water are created using planar reflection, and textures are used to simulate distortions on the water surface. Instead of a classic distance-based fog, a halfspace fog is implemented, which uses an arbitrary plane to cut the space in two halfspaces: one affected and one unaffected by fog.

### Noise Settings

The coherent noise used was 2D fractal Brownian noise (fBm), which adds layers of noise with increasing frequency but decreasing influence. The first layers of noise defines the overall shape of the terrain, while the subsequent layers defines small-scale details of the terrain. The number of layers is denoted by octaves, the sampling frequency is controlled by the lacunarity variable and the influence of each layer is decided by the persistance variable. The following image show the real-time update of the terrain by changing these parameters on the GUI.

### Terrain Tessellation

![Terrain Tessellation](docs/images/tessellation.png?raw=True) <br/> Terrain tessellation generated by tessellation shaders. The level of detail changes dynamically based on the camera distance, creating more triangles for areas closer to the viewer.

### Normal Mapping

Normal mapping allows to increase the appearance of surface details without increasing the geometry (i.e. number of polygons).

### Height-based Texture Blending

The terrain height determines which texture to sample from. To avoid abrupt changes of texture, a blending range is defined, where two textures are blended together. This blending range is determined using a height start and height end parameter for each texture, which creates different effects as desired. The corner cases are the first and last texture, which always start at 0.0 and end at 1.0, respectively.

### Triplanar Texture Mapping

In the images below it's possible to see the effect of a simpler texture mapping, planar mapping (left), compared to triplanar texture mapping (right). Vertical stretches are much more noticeable on the case of planar mapping, specially when the terrain elevation parameter is increased. Those stretches are considerably softned by using triplanar texture mapping.

### Halfspace Fog

Halfspace fog splits the space in two halfspaces, one affected and one unaffected by fog. This allows to create some interesting visual effects, such as fog with linear density on mountain valleys.

| | |
| :---: | :---: |
| ![Fog1](docs/images/fog1.png?raw=True) <br/> Fog height = 20, density constant = 0.001 | ![Fog2](docs/images/fog2.png?raw=True) <br/> Fog height = 20, density constant = 0.1 |
| ![Fog3](docs/images/fog3.png?raw=True) <br/> Fog height = 30.149, density constant = 0.001 | ![Fog4](docs/images/fog4.png?raw=True) <br/> Fog height = 30.149, density constant = 0.011 |

While the usage on this project seems like a height-based fog, the algorithm of halfspace fog is flexible and allows to use an arbitrary plane, and not only an axis-aligned plane, to define regions affected and unaffected by fog.

### Assets License and Download

Unfortunately, some of the textures used in this project cannot be directly redistributed on this repository (or any other file sharing tool) due to licensing; they are free to download and use, but cannot be redistributed outside the original website. 

* Option 1: manually download the textures

In case anyone wants to manually download it, the file `assets/textures/source_textures.txt` contains the links to download. If you extract the files on the correct directories (normal maps into `assets/textures/terrain/normal`, albedos into `assets/textures/terrain/albedo` and ambient occlusion maps into `assets/textures/terrain/ao`), everything should work as expected.

* Option 2: automated script

Alternatively, if you have Python 3.9 and some dependencies installed (`requests`, and optionally `Pillow` in case you want to resize the textures), you can run a provided Python script as follows, with the terminal on the root of this repository:

```
python scripts/prepare_assets.py [--target_size]
```

, which will download the files from the site, optionally resizes the textures (if a value is provided to the argument `--target_size`) and save the files on the directory `assets/textures/terrain`. Notice that this requires an active Internet connection. The bottleneck is the download part, which may be faster or slower depending on your network speed. On my machine the entire script takes around one minute to complete, of which 58 seconds were due to the download.

After that, you can proceed to build the C++/OpenGL code, as described below.
